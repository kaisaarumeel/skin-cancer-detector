To run the application frontend locally, please follow the steps below to start the client development server.

## Running local development server

First ensure you have first followed the steps to run the backend server. Refer to the instructions inside the project `root` directory [README](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit826/2024/group6/-/tree/main#running-the-django-project).

Then, ensure you are in the client project folder
```bash
cd client
```

Install all dependencies (requires `npm`)

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev

# or start server and open directly in new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
